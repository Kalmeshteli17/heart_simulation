## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kalmeshteli17/heart_simulation.git
cd heart_simulation

2. Install dependencies
npm install

3. Run the app locally
npm start
App will be available at http://localhost:3000


📊 Dataset
All datasets used for PQRS waveform generation and visualization are located in:
/datasets/
Feel free to add ECG recordings, MIT-BIH samples, or synthetic signal datasets here.

 Notebooks

You’ll find Google Colab-compatible notebooks under:
/notebooks/ecg-analysis.ipynb
This includes:

Signal cleaning & smoothing

Peak detection

PQRS interval annotation

BPM estimation



Git Ignore Highlights
Your .gitignore prevents the following from being tracked:
node_modules/
build/
.env*
*.log
Your datasets, notebooks, and source files will be safely committed to GitHub.
